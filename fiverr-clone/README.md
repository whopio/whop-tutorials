# GigFlow (Fiverr Clone)

A freelance services marketplace where verified sellers list tiered gig packages, buyers pay through an in-app checkout with a configurable platform fee, and the two coordinate via embedded chat for the full delivery lifecycle. Built with Next.js 16, Supabase, and the Whop SDK.

## Features

- **Direct Charges with Application Fees** - Buyers pay sellers' connected Whop companies; the platform's cut is captured via `application_fee_amount`
- **Embedded Checkout** - `<WhopCheckoutEmbed />` slides over the gig page; no redirect off the domain
- **Embedded KYC + Payouts** - `<VerifyElement />` and `<PayoutsSession>` keep verification and withdrawals inside the seller dashboard
- **Tiered Gig Packages** - Basic / Standard / Premium tiers with optional add-ons
- **Order Lifecycle State Machine** - Requirements → in_progress → delivered → completed, with revision and dispute branches
- **Embedded Buyer/Seller Chat** - `<ChatElement />` per order with a Supabase Realtime fallback when a user has not linked Whop
- **Whop OAuth (PKCE)** - Login with Whop using chat scopes; email/password through Supabase Auth as a fallback
- **Reviews** - Star ratings on delivered orders with auto-completion when a review is left
- **Webhook-Driven Reconciliation** - `unwrapWebhook` verifies every payment, refund, dispute and KYC event. Each event is stored once, and payments are matched to their order by checkout configuration
- **Database-Enforced KYC Gate** - A Postgres trigger rejects gig publishes from unverified sellers, even on direct API calls
- **Row Level Security** - Self / participant / admin policies on every table

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project
- A [Whop Developer Account](https://whop.com/developer)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whopio/whop-tutorials.git
cd whop-tutorials/fiverr-clone
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Copy the example env file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

See `.env.example` for all required variables and where to find them.

### 4. Set up the database

Install the Supabase CLI, link your project, and apply the migrations:

```bash
npm install -g supabase
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
supabase db push
```

This applies every file in `supabase/migrations/` in order, including the schema, seed categories, RLS policies, and the KYC enforcement trigger.

Optional: seed demo gigs, sellers, and reviews.

```bash
npm run seed:gigs
```

### 5. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 6. Configure Whop

This app uses Whop sandbox mode by default. Use [sandbox.whop.com](https://sandbox.whop.com) for development and switch to production once you are live.

#### API key and platform company

1. In your Whop dashboard, copy your platform parent company ID from the URL (`biz_xxxxxxxxxxxx`) into `WHOP_PLATFORM_COMPANY_ID`.
2. **Developer → API Keys → Create** — generate a Company API key with payments, KYC, and payouts permissions. Set as `WHOP_API_KEY`.
3. If your Company key cannot grant `dms:channel:manage`, create a Whop App and use its API key as `WHOP_APP_API_KEY` for chat routes.

#### OAuth

1. **Developer → Apps → OAuth** — create or open your OAuth app.
2. Register redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/whop` for development
   - `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/whop` for production
3. Copy the client ID and secret into `WHOP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `WHOP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
4. Enable scopes: `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `chat:read`, `chat:message:create`, `dms:read`, `dms:message:manage`, `dms:channel:manage`, `support_chat:read`, `support_chat:message:create`.

The `scripts/create-whop-oauth-app.js` helper can create or update the app via API if you prefer to manage it from code.

#### Webhooks

1. **Developer → Webhooks → Create** — point the endpoint at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/whop`.
2. Subscribe to the events the handler acts on: `payment_succeeded`, `refund_created`, `refund_updated`, `dispute_created`, `dispute_updated` and `verification_succeeded`. The payload `type` arrives dotted (`payment.succeeded`).
3. Copy the signing secret into `WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. The handler verifies every request with `unwrapWebhook` from `@whop/sdk/helpers`, using the raw secret, before acting on it.

## Sandbox vs Production

| Environment | Dashboard | API | Payments |
|-------------|-----------|-----|----------|
| **Sandbox** | sandbox.whop.com | sandbox-api.whop.com | Test cards only |
| **Production** | whop.com | api.whop.com | Real payments |

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_ENVIRONMENT="sandbox"` for development and switch to `production` when you go live. The SDK clients, the OAuth URLs and the embedded components all read this value to point at the right API.

### Test Cards (Sandbox)

- `4242 4242 4242 4242` - Successful payment
- Any future expiration date and any 3-digit CVC

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push this directory to a GitHub repo (or import the parent `whop-tutorials` repo and deploy this subdirectory).
2. Add every variable from `.env.example` to **Settings → Environment Variables** for **Production** and **Preview**.
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your canonical production URL (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`) so OAuth redirects never use a preview deployment URL that might require login.
4. After deploying, register the production redirect URI in your Whop OAuth app and the production webhook URL in **Developer → Webhooks**.

### Other Platforms

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Requires Node.js 20.9+ runtime, a Supabase project, and all environment variables configured.
